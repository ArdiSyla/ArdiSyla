## 💡 Insights and Analysis of My GitHub Activity

Thank you for taking the time to review my GitHub profile. Here is an analysis of my GitHub activity and some insights about my skill set and interests:

**Overall Activity, Skill Set, and Interests:**

Based on my nine public repositories, I have demonstrated a moderate level of activity on GitHub. I enjoy developing diverse applications, as shown by the variety of my projects, including a calculator, an Etch-a-Sketch app, a product store application, and a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. This indicates my interest in learning and developing my skills across different areas of web development.

While my bio is currently incomplete, the creation date of my account suggests that I am a relatively new GitHub user focused on learning and building my skills. My most starred repository, the Calculator, showcases my proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which are essential front-end development languages.

**Coding Habits:**

I have contributed a total of 61 commits to my projects, demonstrating a steady commitment to coding and making progress. Although the commit frequency cannot be determined without timestamp information, I strive to code consistently and make regular contributions.

My repositories primarily utilize JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and PHP, indicating my proficiency in full-stack web development technologies. Investing time in these languages has allowed me to develop well-rounded skills and create projects across both front-end and back-end areas.

**Project Contributions:**

While I have not contributed to any external repositories, I have created multiple personal projects and exercises covering different areas of web development, including front-end, back-end, and full-stack applications. Although I have not actively engaged in collaborative projects or open-source contributions, I am actively working on developing my skills and looking forward to future opportunities for collaboration.

**GitHub Presence:**

At present, I have no followers on GitHub. This is likely because I am still establishing my presence on the platform and have not actively promoted my projects. As a relatively new user, I am prioritizing learning and personal growth.

Exploring my repository codes and commit history will provide a more comprehensive understanding of my coding habits, skills, and interests. I encourage you to dig deeper and get a more detailed view of my journey as a web developer.
